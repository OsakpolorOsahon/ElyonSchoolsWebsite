## System Architecture

### Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) running on port 5000
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth via `@supabase/ssr` (cookie-based sessions)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS (New York style)
- **Payments**: Paystack (inline JS popup + server-side verification)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (`gallery` bucket) for uploaded images
- **Color Scheme**: Green primary HSL(133 65% 28%), gold accent HSL(50 100% 50%)

### Routing Strategy (App Router route groups)

- `(marketing)` — Public pages: home, about, academics, admissions, gallery, news, payments, contact, downloads
- `(auth)` — Auth pages at `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`
- `(portal)` — Protected dashboards: `/admin`, `/teacher`, `/parent`, `/student`

### Key Files

- `proxy.ts` — Auth middleware (exported as `proxy` not `middleware` — Next.js 16 requirement)
- `next.config.js` — Next.js config with `allowedDevOrigins` for Replit
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — Server-side Supabase client (cookie-based)
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — Browser-side Supabase client
- `lib/supabase/admin.ts` — Service-role client for bypassing RLS on server writes
- `components/portal/PortalHeader.tsx` — Shared header with logout for all portals + current term badge from `academic_settings`
- `components/portal/PaymentReceiptModal.tsx` — Printable payment receipt modal

### Environment Variables (Replit Secrets)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` — Supabase service role key (for admin writes)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` — Paystack public key (optional)
- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` — Paystack secret key for server-side verification (optional)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — Full URL of the site (used for invite redirects)

## Database Schema (Supabase)

The complete schema is in `supabase/setup.sql`. For existing installations, run migration files in `supabase/migrations/` in order:
1. `20240101000001_initial_schema.sql` — Core tables
2. `20240101000002_rls_policies.sql` — RLS policies for core tables
3. `20240102000001_new_features.sql` — New tables + payment columns
4. `002_extended_features.sql` — Student lifecycle, subjects mapping, fees, report cards, staff profiles

### Core Tables
- `profiles` — User profiles with `role` (admin | teacher | parent | student)
- `students` — Student records with `status` (active | graduated | withdrawn | transferred), `department` (Science | Commercial | Art, for SSS only), `graduation_year`, `transfer_note`, `repeating` (boolean, default false — when true, student stays in current class during bulk promotion and flag auto-clears after promotion run)
- `class_teacher` — Links one teacher to one class (14 classes: Nursery 1–2, Primary 1–6, JSS 1–3, SSS 1–3)
- `admissions` — Admission applications (`student_data` JSONB, `guardian_data` JSONB, `status`, `amount`)
- `payments` — Payment records with `student_id` FK, `recorded_by` (admin for offline), `notes`, `term`, `year`, `method` (paystack | cash | bank_transfer)
- `subjects` — Subject records with `applicable_classes` TEXT[] and `applicable_departments` TEXT[] (empty = applies to all)
- `exams` — Exam records with `published` BOOLEAN and `teacher_remarks_open` BOOLEAN. Publication is enforced by RLS: students and parents can only see results for published exams; teachers and admins see all.
- `student_results` — Results linked to student, exam, subject with `remarks` for teacher comments

### New Feature Tables
- `academic_settings` — Single-row config: `current_term`, `current_year`, `school_name`, `principal_name`
- `fee_structures` — Fee definitions per class/term/year/type with `amount`
- `staff_profiles` — Teacher profiles: `subject_specialty`, `qualification`, `phone`, `bio`
- `report_card_comments` — Principal's comments per student per exam

### Other Tables
- `announcements` — School announcements with `target_audience`, `is_published`
- `gallery_items` — Gallery photos with `storage_path` and `public_url` from Supabase Storage
- `contact_submissions` — Contact form submissions
- `news_posts` — News articles with `status` (draft | published)
- `events` — School events with `start_ts`, `end_ts`, `category`

## Auth Flow

1. `proxy.ts` intercepts all requests, checks Supabase session
2. Portal routes (`/admin`, `/teacher`, `/parent`, `/student`) redirect to `/login` if no valid session + matching role
3. Login/signup flow at `/login` → role-based redirect to appropriate dashboard
4. Sign Out: calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` → redirects to `/login`

## Setup Notes for Production

1. Run all SQL migrations in Supabase SQL Editor (in order)
2. Create `gallery` bucket in Supabase Storage with public access
3. Set all environment variables in Replit Secrets
4. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` and `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` are set for payments to work
5. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set to the production URL for invite emails to work
